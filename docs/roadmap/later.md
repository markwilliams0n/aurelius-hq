# Long-Term Vision

Where Aurelius is headed.

---

## Core Philosophy

Aurelius is a **personal AI chief of staff** that:
- Remembers everything important about your work and relationships
- Triages incoming information so you focus on what matters
- Takes action on your behalf when appropriate
- Learns your preferences and patterns over time

---

## Major Features (Someday)

### Proactive Intelligence
- Morning briefings based on calendar + memory
- "You should follow up with X, it's been 2 weeks"
- Meeting prep with relevant context auto-surfaced
- Pattern detection: "You've snoozed emails from Y 5 times"

### Multi-Modal Input
- Voice notes → transcribed and triaged
- Screenshots → OCR and context extraction
- Photos → people recognition, event logging

### Delegation & Automation
- Draft responses for approval
- Auto-schedule meetings based on preferences
- Create tasks from commitments automatically
- File documents to appropriate places

### Team Features
- Shared memory (company knowledge base)
- Delegation to team members
- Meeting notes shared with attendees
- Handoff context when reassigning

### Integrations Wishlist
- Calendar (Google, Outlook) - for scheduling context
- CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot) - for relationship context
- Documents (Google Drive, Dropbox) - for file context
- Communication (WhatsApp, Telegram) - more message sources

## Technical Vision

### Local-First
- Works offline with sync
- Data stays on your machine by default
- Optional cloud sync for multi-device

### Privacy by Design
- Encrypted at rest
- No training on your data
- Clear data retention policies
- Export everything

### Extensible
- Plugin/connector architecture
- Custom AI models
- Webhook integrations
- API for external tools

## Non-Goals

Things Aurelius is NOT trying to be:
- A general-purpose AI assistant (focused on work/productivity)
- A social media manager
- A customer support tool
- A team collaboration platform (it's personal-first)

*This is aspirational. Priorities change based on what's actually useful.*
